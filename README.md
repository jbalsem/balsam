# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Driven by a passion for problem-solving and innovation, Iâ€™m a computer science student with a growing interest in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and software development. I thrive in environments that challenge me to combine creativity, logic, and technology to build meaningful solutions. Balancing academics with leadership roles and part-time work, Iâ€™ve honed a strong work ethic and a commitment to lifelong learning. When Iâ€™m not coding or exploring new tech trends, I enjoy practicing yoga, immersing myself in books, and embracing outdoor adventures.
